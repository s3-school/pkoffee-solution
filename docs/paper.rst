Abstract
--------

Coffee consumption is often associated with productivity gains in software
engineering, as productivity is multi-dimensional and influenced by task complexity,
individual differences, and environmental factors. This study investigates the
relationship between coffee consumption and developer productivity through a controlled
observational study conducted over six months in a software engineering laboratory
with 40 participants.

Developer participants self-reported coffee consumption data throughout their
development sessions, while their development activity and defect-related events were
automatically logged via instrumented IDEs. Results indicate a complex, nonlinear
relationship between coffee intake and productivity metrics.
